# dotfiles #

Everyone has a dotfiles repo, right?  Well this is mine.  It is structured as a castle for the [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) tool, which allows easy management for dotfile repos.

## Included Tools ##
This repo contains dotfiles for the tools I use most often

### vim ###
Vim is a great editor.  If you don't know how to use it, then you should definitely invest the time to learn.  My .vimrc files are built on top of the popular [spf13](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim) distribution

### Emacs ###
Most people learn one editor, and it is the one they love for the rest of their lives.  But for me, one is not enough.  [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is the other of the two giants, and definitely worth your time to learn.

**NOTE** My emacs configuration is actually stored in another [repository](https://github.com/keelerm84/.emacs.d).

### tmux ###
A fantastic [terminal multiplexer](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/).  I was an avid [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) user for a long time, but I have come to appreciate the awesomeness that is tmux.

### zsh ###
[bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is fantastic.  There is no denying it.  But I must say, I have come to love [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/).  It's quite amazing.

### irssi ###
IRC is a fantastic way to connect with developers who share your interests.  There are a lot of programs out there one can use with IRC, but my chosen tool is [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/).

### Misc ###
There are a handful of other little config files that must be included on any machine on which I work.  These include:

* [git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [dircolors](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/dircolors-invocation.html)
* And of course an aliases file
